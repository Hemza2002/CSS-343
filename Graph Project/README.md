# Graph

Graph class with several graph algorithms including depth-first search, 
breadth-first search, dijkstra's shortest path, minimum spanning tree


## Included Files

- `graph.h, graph.cpp`: Graph class

- `graphtest.cpp`: Test functions give errors in output.txt. I will not modify graphtest.cpp and keep it as it was given to me from professor. 

- `main.cpp`: A generic main file to call testAll() to run all tests
